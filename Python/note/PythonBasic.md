## Statements
* Conditional Steps - if ... elif .. else
```Python
if (expression):
   (command)
elif (expression):
   (command)
else:
   (command)
```
* Conditional Steps (Multi elif) - if ... elif .. else
```Python
if x < 0:
    x = 0
    print 'negative changed to zero'
elif x == 0:
    print 'zero'
elif x == 1:
    print 'single'
elif x == 2:
    print 'double'
else:
    print 'more'
```
* Repeated steps - while
```Python
while i < 6:
    print "At the top i is %d" % i
```
* Repeated steps - another example \
Assign a value to i which is greater than 2
```Python
while i > 2:
    print "Right now i is %d" % i
    i=i-1
```
* Loop - for
```Python
for (y) in (x):
    (command)
```

## hardware architecture
* __CPU__ (central processing unit) – runs the program; not the brains exactly; very very fast
* __RAM__ (random access memory) – main memory; fast, small, temporary storage; lost on shutdown or reboot
* __secondary memory__ - slower, large, permanent memory; lasts until deleted; examples are disk drives and memory sticks
* __input devices__ – used to give data to the CPU;keyboard, mouse, touch screen
* __output devices__ – screen, speakers, printer, DVD burner
* __network__ - retrieve info from network, but not always available; almost like a secondary memory, slower and less reliable
